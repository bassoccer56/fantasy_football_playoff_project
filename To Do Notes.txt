To Do:

- Update main.py script to run in perpetuity, updating player game stats every 15 minutes during the Super Bowl (or based on remaining API calls, 84.5% used)

- Check to confirm that configuration is not looking at Localhost database

- Ask Chike what info he needs for projections, found in "Get NFL Betting Odds" endpoint; teamDefenseProjections in "Get Fantasy Point Projections" endpoint

- Check how many API calls are needed to update scores in a game


Down the line

- Add change log to table "Get Changelog" endpoint

- Consider adding "Get NFL Depth Charts" endpoint eventually
